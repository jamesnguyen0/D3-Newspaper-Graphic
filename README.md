## Background

A newspaper editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). This set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Functionality

Fully interactive data visualization using D3 and Javascript for animation and renders. Labels in the scatter plot have click events so that users can decide which data to display. D3 graphics also reveal a specific element's data when users hover their cursor over the element using tooltips on the circles.
